/*
pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH): This function measures the 
duration in microseconds for the pulse to travel from the 
ultrasonic sensor and back. It takes two parameters: the 
echoPin which is the pin connected to the echo signal of 
the sensor, and HIGH which indicates that the pulse is 
expected to be high.

* 0.034: Since the speed of sound is approximately 343 meters 
per second (or 34,300 centimeters per second), we can use this 
constant to convert the time duration into distance. 
By multiplying the duration by 0.034, we convert it to 
centimeters.

/ 2: In the ultrasonic sensor setup, the pulse travels from 
the sensor to the object and back. Therefore, we need to 
divide the calculated distance by 2 to get the actual distance 
from the sensor to the object. This is because the calculated 
distance represents the round-trip distance.
